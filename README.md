# Welcome to LaraTube (WIP)

This project is a multimedia-plattform for various scenarios, primary for video and audio (via upload, link and webtorrent).

The project is completly licensed with the GPL v3.

However, it's whished on the developers side to not use this software for:

- Porn (this industry have enough money)
- Illegal or even discracing violence
- Pro army / police / fashist / racist-sites

By license, you can use the software for anything. If i (the developer) detect this on the bugtracker or in personal contact, it can lead to deny personal help or loosing contact - this is my right.
